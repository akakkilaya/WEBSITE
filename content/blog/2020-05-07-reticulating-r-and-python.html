<p>In this blog post, I combine my passion for literature, research, and Python. I began reading classic books in the second grade, and one of my favorite was Moby Dick by Herman Melville. In the code block below, I have created a string of the opening paragraph of the book. I then took out all the punctuation marks with re.sub() and replaced them with spaces. I then made the string into a list of lower case words. I then did a count function to calculate how many times each word appears in the list.</p>

string6=&quot;Call me Ishmael. Some years ago — never mind how long precisely — having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off — then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.&quot;

<p>The summer before my senior year, I worked at MD Anderson where I worked with plasmids and bacterial cultures. Plasmids are cut using restriction fragments that can target specific sequences within a larger sequence. Below, I have created an example of how one would calculate the number of cuts and fragments one would expect from using the following restriction fragments: ANTAAT and GCRWTG.</p>
